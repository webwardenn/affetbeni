#ToMyLittlePrincess

This project is a cute and interactive web page. It starts with an ASCII-art heart animation, followed by an interface that asks the user, "Do you forgive me?" The "Yes" button responds with a sweet message and heart effects, while the "No" button playfully escapes. ðŸ˜Š

## Features
- **ASCII Heart Animation**: An ASCII heart drawing appears and slowly fades away when the page loads.
- **Interactive Buttons**:
- The "Yes" button displays a sweet message and floating heart effects with SweetAlert2.
- The "No" button escapes to a random location when hovered over.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on any device with responsive design.
- **Simple and Smooth**: Minimalist style, fluid animations, and optimized performance.
